- <img src="logos (for description)/cake.png" width="30"> chocolate cake

## how can i download this?
these resource packs are discontinued so you will not find them on modrinth and this is the only way
to get them

go to the resourcepakcs folder in the repo and click on the one you want, then click view raw
